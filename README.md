# Settlers of Catan (board game)
This is my attempt in re-creating the board game "Settlers of Catan" using the Svelte framework with TypeScript. 

My goal is to eventually use this code to train a machine learning model to play the game better than my friends. 

This is my first attempt at using Svelte in a project. I like it much more than React.
